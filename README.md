Data Cataloging: Implemented Microsoft Purview Data Catalog to scan, classify, and maintain metadata lineage across Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2), Azure SQL Databases, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Factory pipelines. Configured automated scanning schedules to ensure metadata freshness and enabled enterprise-wide data discovery, impact analysis, and root cause tracing for downstream reporting issues.

Data Curation & Governance: Managed end-to-end asset registration and curation workflows within Microsoft Purview, organizing data assets into logical collections based on business domains (Claims, Policy, Underwriting). Associated glossary terms with technical assets to bridge business and technical vocabularies, and applied governance policies aligned with organizational data access standards, role-based permissions, and regulatory requirements.

Business Glossary & Critical Data Elements (CDEs): Collaborated with data owners, subject matter experts, and data stewards across business units to define, document, and maintain enterprise business glossaries in Microsoft Purview. Implemented Critical Data Elements using standardized glossary terms, custom classifications, and tagged column-level attributes to support regulatory reporting (NAIC, state filings), financial reconciliation, and business-critical analytics. Established approval workflows and term lifecycle management to ensure glossary accuracy and relevance.

Data Profiling & Quality Assessment: Performed comprehensive data profiling using SQL-based validation logic, Azure Data Factory data flow transformations, and Synapse notebooks to assess data completeness, accuracy, consistency, and conformity across key datasets. Analyzed profiling outputs to identify anomalies such as null concentrations, outliers, duplicate patterns, and referential integrity gaps. Documented findings in quality assessment reports and communicated insights to data owners and stewards for prioritized remediation and root cause resolution.

Security Classification & Compliance: Applied sensitivity labels and automated classification rules using Microsoft Purview Information Protection integrated with Microsoft 365 compliance center. Configured data classification policies to identify and safeguard sensitive data including PII (SSN, policy holder details), PHI (health-related claims data), and financial information, supporting GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and internal data security policies. Enabled audit trails and access logging for compliance evidence and regulatory reporting.

Data Quality Monitoring & Reporting: Designed business-driven data quality metrics and validation rules implemented through SQL stored procedures, Azure Data Factory pipelines, and Logic Apps for alerting. Defined quality dimensions (completeness, validity, timeliness, uniqueness) mapped to specific business KPIs. Built interactive Power BI scorecards and dashboards to visualize quality trends over time, track rule performance by domain, highlight data debt areas, and support governance decision-making and remediation prioritization.

Metadata Migration (Legacy Catalog to Microsoft Purview): Developed a Python-based automation tool to migrate metadata from legacy data catalog systems (including Informatica EDC and custom SharePoint-based catalogs) to Microsoft Purview, reducing manual migration effort by 60% and accelerating time-to-value. Extracted business terms, asset definitions, data classifications, ownership information, and lineage relationships via REST APIs, JDBC connections, and native export utilities. Transformed extracted metadata into Apache Atlas-compatible JSON formats using pandas and custom mapping logic, then loaded assets into Microsoft Purview through bulk REST API calls. Conducted iterative validation cycles, reconciling migrated content against source systems to ensure accuracy, completeness, hierarchy preservation, and relationship integrity. Delivered migration runbooks and handover documentation for ongoing catalog maintenance.

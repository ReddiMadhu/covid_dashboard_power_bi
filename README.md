PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Data Governance & Analytics Framework Implementation | Major U.S. Insurance Client
Data Cataloging: Implemented Microsoft Purview Data Catalog to scan, classify, and maintain metadata lineage across Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure SQL Databases, and Azure Data Factory pipelines, enabling enterprise-wide data discovery and impact analysis.

Data Curation & Governance: Managed asset registration and curation workflows within Microsoft Purview, organizing data assets into collections, associating glossary terms, and applying governance policies aligned with organizational standards and access requirements.

Business Glossary & Critical Data Elements (CDEs): Collaborated with data owners and stewards to define and maintain business glossaries in Microsoft Purview. Implemented Critical Data Elements using standardized glossary terms, custom classifications, and tagged attributes to support regulatory reporting and business-critical analytics.

Data Profiling & Quality Assessment: Performed data profiling using SQL-based validation logic and Azure Data Factory data flow transformations to assess data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Analyzed profiling outputs to identify anomalies and communicated findings to data owners for remediation.

Security Classification & Compliance: Applied sensitivity labels and automated classification rules using Microsoft Purview Information Protection to identify and safeguard sensitive data and PII, supporting GDPR, HIPAA, and internal data security policies.

Data Quality Monitoring & Reporting: Designed business-driven data quality metrics and validation rules implemented through SQL stored procedures and ADF pipelines. Built Power BI scorecards and dashboards to visualize quality trends, track rule performance, and support governance decision-making.

Metadata Migration Accelerator (Legacy Catalog to Microsoft Purview) | Center of Excellence Team
Overview: Developed a Python-based automation tool enabling metadata migration from legacy data catalog systems to Microsoft Purview. Preserved accurate lineage mappings and reduced manual migration effort by 60%.

Extraction: Retrieved metadata from source catalog systems through REST API integrations and native exports, capturing business terms, asset definitions, classifications, and relationship information. Consolidated outputs into structured Excel workbooks for validation and mapping.

Analysis: Analyzed extracted metadata to map asset relationships, glossary hierarchies, and classification taxonomies. Documented transformation gaps and established source-to-target mappings for Purview alignment using configuration templates.

Transformation & Loading: Transformed exported metadata (CSV/JSON) into Apache Atlas-compatible formats and loaded assets into Microsoft Purview through REST APIs. Generated glossary terms with proper hierarchy and relationship mappings.

Validation: Reconciled migrated assets against source systems to verify accuracy, completeness, and relationship integrity. Documented migration outcomes and resolved discrepancies through iterative validation cycles.

Data Quality Migration Utility (On-Premise to Azure Cloud) | Center of Excellence Team
Developed an automation utility to parse legacy data quality rule configurations and transform them into Azure-compatible formats, generating comprehensive rule documentation and migration metadata. Enabled seamless transition of quality monitoring workflows to Azure SQL and ADF, preserving assessment capabilities during cloud migration.

AI-Assisted Governance – Proof of Concept | Center of Excellence Team
Contributed to AI-assisted data governance proof-of-concept by preparing and structuring test datasets within Microsoft Purview. Evaluated automated classification accuracy and documented findings for data steward onboarding and adoption planning.
